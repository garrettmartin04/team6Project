Created a study platform called NoteStream, which provides users with a few different tools that they can use to study and create notes for themselves Among the tools included are notes, quizzes, and flashcards. Users will also be able to add friends and collaborate on notes together. A support email has also been created in case any concerns or bugs arise that need to be addressed.

Execution: I developed most of the backend in Java, JavaScript, with alot of CSS and HTML

Notes: 
Users can create a new note for whatever purpose they desire, and give it a name once they are finished. Additionally, users will be able to edit and delete previouslly saved notes if they desire.

Quizzes:
Users can create quizzes and add as many questions as they would like. When a quiz is created, it can also be viewed, edited, and deleted. Additionally, when the user has completed a quiz, a score will be displayed after the final question is answering informing the user of their score.

Flashcards:
Users can create flashcard sets with any name and add as many cards to the created set as they would like. A term can be created on one side, and the answer on the other. When done, the user can see all saved flashcard sets, as well as edit or delete any previously created sets. When reviewing a set, the user can hit the "Show Answer" button, which will reveal the correct answer/definition for the term on the flashcard. 

Friends:
Users will be able to send friend requests and acceot them from other registered users. They will also be able to collaborate on notes if the creator of the note has given the collaborator(s) permission to do so. Users will also be able to delete friends if they wish to.

Misc:
Users can create an account, which will be verified through email. An option to delete the account will also be available. An "about" page will be created, detailing the creators of the service and their role in the project, as well as other information such as contact info. The code will also be open source, so anyone may view the source files for the project.
